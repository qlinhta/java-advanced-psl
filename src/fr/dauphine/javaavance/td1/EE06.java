    We now want to defined a ring.
    A ring is a circle with a center and a radius.
    It also has a second radius that is smaller than the first one.
    The ring is the area between the two circles.

    1. Should we use inheritance and why?
    >>
    Yes, because a ring is a circle with a hole in the middle
    Inheritance should only be used when:
    Both classes are in the same logical domain.
    The subclass is a proper subtype of the superclass.
    The superclass's implementation is necessary or appropriate for the subclass.

    /*
    2. Write a new class Ring, with a center and two radius (beware, the inner radius
    must always be smaller than the outer one.
